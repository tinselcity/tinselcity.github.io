title: Grabbing Source IP Address with UDP connect
---

I've been reading the [Transmission](https://github.com/transmission/transmission) source code and playing with writing my own [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) [client](https://github.com/tinselcity/ntrnt) (just to learn about the protocols especially [Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia)).  One detail that I think is common in peer to peer applications is the requirement to announce a client's ability to join a swarm.

In BitTorrent, in the ["Tracker Request"](https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification#Tracker_Request_Parameters), a client connects to a tracker and can send a `GET` request including the client's ip address in the query string:

```sh
GET /announce?info_hash=XXX&ipv6=<ipv6 address>&<other_fields> HTTP/1.1
```

[Transmission](https://github.com/transmission/transmission) has an interesting snippet of code to support grabbing the clients "true IP address".

/* Get the source address used for a given destination address. Since
   there is no official interface to get this information, we create
   a connected UDP socket (connected UDP... hmm...) and check its source
   address. */
static int get_source_address(struct sockaddr const* dst,
                              socklen_t dst_len,
                              struct sockaddr* src,
                              socklen _t* src_len)
{
    tr_socket_t const s = socket(dst->sa_family, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
    if (s == TR_BAD_SOCKET)
    {
        return -1;
    }

    // since it's a UDP socket, this doesn't actually send any packets
    if (connect(s, dst, dst_len) == 0 && getsockname(s, src, src_len) == 0)
    {
        evutil_closesocket(s);
        return 0;
    }

    auto const save = errno;
    evutil_closesocket(s);
    errno = save;
    return -1;
}
```

The only link I could find related to using UDP `connect` to get a source IP was on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25879380).

Here's a small standalone C program to do the same thing:
[https://github.com/tinselcity/experiments/blob/master/get_my_ip/get_my_ip.c](https://github.com/tinselcity/experiments/blob/master/get_my_ip/get_my_ip.c)

Building/Running:
```sh
~># Building...
~>gcc get_my_ip.c -o get_my_ip
...
~># Running...
~>./get_my_ip 
: getting public ip address(es)
: trying IPv4...
: warning ipv4 appears to be private address (RFC4193)
: warning: error performing get_public_address (IPv4)
: trying IPv6...
: ipv6: XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX
```

The common use-case of an application's need to know its own source IP address could be why there's a proliferation of sites/API's like ["What's My IP Address"](https://whatismyipaddress.com).  Using UDP `connect`+`getsockname` could be an alternative approach if they're available from the language/OS.
